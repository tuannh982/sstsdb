Simple, Stupid Time Series Database

> K-V storage with simple time tiered compaction policy



This is a simple implementation of K-V DB with time tiered compaction policy. 
The code is a mess, but it only contains a small amount of classes, so it's not 
so hard to look into the implementation. Beside the messy code, this implementation
is low on running performance and should only be used for educational purpose.
